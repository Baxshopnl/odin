# Odin Domain Monitor

## Disclaimer

Odin is an example project built using [Maelstrom CMS Toolkit](https://www.maelstrom-cms.com/).

It is not a final release - it's an in-house tool which we use to provide basic monitoring with email alerts that receives regular bug fixes and new features as/when we need them internally.

We're simply open-sourcing it to allow others that might find it useful to use to use, we don't provide any support SLAs, however if bugs are found we'll investigate when we can, and if there's feature requests we'll consider. Pull Requests for new features/bug fixes are welcome, however we recommend opening an issue and discussing them before spending time doing it.

## What is it?

Odin is a domain monitoring tool which has the following monitors:

- OpenGraph extraction.
- Uptime Monitoring with response-time graph and e-mail notifications.
- Downtime event tracking with duration.

- Robots.txt Monitoring to email changes for review - No more accidently blocking you're website.
- Basic DNS Monitoring to detect name-server and primary A Records changes
